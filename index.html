          <p>
            This aspect of the digital divide – often referred to as the
            “homework gap” – can be an academic burden for teens who lack access
            to digital technologies at home. Black teens, as well as those from
            lower-income households, are especially likely to face these
            school-related challenges as a result, according to the new Center
            survey of 743 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 conducted March 7–April 10,
            2018.

            of U.S. parents with lower incomes say their child may face digital
            obstacles in schoolwork.
          </h1>
          <p>
            A new analysis of Pew Research Center data collected in early April
            finds that 59% of parents with lower incomes who had children in
            schools that were remote at the time said their children would
            likely face at least one of three digital obstacles asked about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, 38% of parents with children whose K-12 schools closed in
            the spring said that their child was very or somewhat likely to face
            one or more of these issues. In addition, parents with middle
            incomes were about twice as likely as parents with higher incomes to
            report anticipating issues.
