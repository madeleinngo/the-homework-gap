        <h4>Pre-Covid</h4>
        <h1>
          15% of school-age children say they cannot always finish homework
          because of the digital divide.
        </h1>
        <span class="highlight"></span>
        <p>
          This aspect of the digital divide – often referred to as the “homework
          gap” – can be an academic burden for teens who lack access to digital
          technologies at home. Black teens, as well as those from lower-income
          households, are especially likely to face these school-related
          challenges as a result, according to the new Center survey of 743 U.S.
          teens ages 13 to 17 conducted March 7–April 10, 2018.

        <h4>The Covid Effect</h4>
        <h1>
          59% of U.S. parents with lower incomes say their child may face
          digital obstacles in schoolwork.
        </h1>
        <span class="highlight"></span>
        <p>
          A new analysis of Pew Research Center data collected in early April
          finds that 59% of parents with lower incomes who had children in
          schools that were remote at the time said their children would likely
          face at least one of three digital obstacles asked about.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Overall, 38% of parents with children whose K-12 schools closed in the
          spring said that their child was very or somewhat likely to face one
          or more of these issues. In addition, parents with middle incomes were
          about twice as likely as parents with higher incomes to report
          anticipating issues.
